## Rebecca Parker

I completed the [Makers developer bootcamp](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in July 2021. I now work as a Software Engineer at [Regate Software](https://www.red-gate.com/), where I test and write code as part of a team. We build and improve database tools for our awesome customers.

## Makers Academy (Apr 2021 to Jul 2021)

### My coding practices
| I can TDD anything | I am a strong debugger  | I write code that is easy to change |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------|
| <li> I use the AAA principle to structure my testing and I aim for a 'Red, Green, Refactor, Commit' cycle| <li> I take a methodical approach to digesting stack traces and error messages; I gather information, get visibility using `p` / `console.log()`, and use effective search terms to google the solution | <li> I'm in the habit of committing every working change with helpful commit messages and using small PRs, to allow code to be reviewed easily.|
|Recent reviewer feedback: |Recent reviewer feedback: |Recent reviewer feedback: |
| _"You delivered an amazing process, demonstrating the effort you have invested in learning test triangulation. [...] I believe you are at the stage where you can employ your process in the wild."_ | _"You regularly read the stack trace to ensure that you are up-to-date on all possible bugs [...] and used the output discrepancies to reason about the changes youâ€™d make to your code."_| _"You chose descriptive names that communicated the intention behind your code, improving its human interpretation and thus its changeability. The same goes for your test names. Well done!"_|

### My working practices
- Comfortable using GitHub processes for team collaboration on code base
  - PR merge conflict resolution
  - Raising issues and tickets on GitHub project boards
  - Travis and heroku for CI and CD
- Comfortable using online tools to diagram, explore user stories and plan in teams
- I thrive in pair-programming and mob environments
- I participate with and evolve team rituals (stand-ups, retros etc)

## Currently reading/working on

| Title                        | Author            | Notes             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**C# Fundamentals**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-fundamentals-dev/table-of-contents)| Scott Allen | I'm using this to cement the fundamentals of C#, which is the primary language of my day-to-day work at Redgate.|
| [**Explore It!**: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing](https://pragprog.com/titles/ehxta/explore-it/) | Elisabeth Hendrickson | I'm enjoying this read because I'm interested in becoming a stellar tester, using exploratory testing approaches to analyze and investigate software systems. I've found this an easy and engaging read, because the underlying principles seem to echo those I grew confident discussing and applying to good assessment design in my previous role as a Product Manager for an international exam board.|
| [**A Philosophy of Software Design**](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1524677319&sr=8-3&keywords=john+ousterhout) | John Ousterhoust | The author's conclusion that _"Dealing with complexity is the most important challenge in software design"_ matches my experience so far developing software against seemingly simple user stories! This book was recommended to me after my week of work experience at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com/) and I'm keen to finish it because I've been working on my SOLID and TDD processes to reconcile iterative, agile approaches, with the incremental nature of complexity. For each of the projects we've worked on at Makers, I've always found the planning and modelling stages to be secretly really fascinating, and definitely a key predictor of the final build success.|
