## Rebecca Parker

I am a career-changer, set to finish the [Makers developer bootcamp](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in July 2021 and enter the tech sector as a software engineer. Here I am, making magic happen during my Makers Bootcamp:

## Currently reading/working on
| Title                        | Author            | Notes             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Learn React**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)| Codecademy | I'm using this to learn the basic syntax of JSX and React for an upcoming project. React promises to be a useful tool to add to my existing Javascript single-page-app skills.|
| **Explore It!: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing** | Elisabeth Hendrickson | I'm enjoying this read because I'm interested in becoming a stellar tester, using exploratory testing appraches to analyze and investigate software systems. I've found this an easy and engaging read, because the underlying principles seem to echo those I grew confident discussing and applying to good assessment design in my previous role as a Product Manager for an international exam board.|
| **A Philosophy of Software Design** | John Ousterhoust | The author's conclusion that _"Dealing with complexity is the most important challenge in software design"_ matches my experience so far developing software against seemingly simple user stories! This book was recommended to me after my week of work experience at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com/) and I'm keen to finish it because I've been working on my SOLID and TDD processes to reconcile interative, agile approaches, with the incremental nature of complexity. For each of the projects we've worked on at Makers, I've always found the planning and modelling stages to be secrectly really fascinating, and definitely a key predictor of the final build success.|


## Makers Academy (Apr 2021 to Jul 2021)

### My coding practices
| I can TDD anything | I am a strong debugger  | I write code that is easy to change |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------|
| <li> I use the AAA principle to structure my testing and I aim for a 'Red, Green, Refactor, Commit' cycle| <li> I take a methodical approach to digesting error messages; I gather information, get visibility using `p` / `console.log()`, and use effective search terms to google the solution | <li> I'm in the habit of commiting every working change with helpful commit messages, allowing code to be reinstated easily when necessary.|
|Recent reviewer feedback: |Recent reviewer feedback: |Recent reviewer feedback: |
| _"You delivered an amazing process, demonstrating the effort you have invested in learning test triangulation. [...] I believe you are at the stage where you can employ your process in the wild."_ | _"You regularly read the stack trace to ensure that you are up-to-date on all possible bugs [...] and used the output discrepancies to reason about the changes youâ€™d make to your code."_| _"You chose descriptive names that communicated the intention behind your code, improving its human interpretation and thus its changeability. The same goes for your test names. Well done!"_|
