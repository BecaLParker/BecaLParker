## Rebecca Parker

I am a career-changer, set to finish the [Makers developer bootcamp](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in July 2021 and enter the tech sector as a software engineer. Here I am, making magic happen during my Makers Bootcamp:

## Currently reading/working on
| Title                        | Author            | Notes             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Learn React**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)| Codecademy | I'm using this to learn the basic syntax of JSX and React for an upcoming project. React promises to be a useful tool to add to my existing Javascript single-page-app skills.|
| **Explore It!: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing** | Elisabeth Hendrickson | I'm enjoying this read because I'm interested in becoming a stellar tester, using exploratory testing appraches to analyze and investigate software systems. I've found this an easy and engaging read, because the underlying principles seem to echo those I grew confident discussing and applying to good assessment design in my previous role as a Product Manager for an international exam board.|
| **A Philosophy of Software Design** | John Ousterhoust | The author's conclusion that _"Dealing with complexity is the most important challenge in software design"_ matches my experience so far developing software against seemingly simple user stories! This book was recommended to me after my week of work experience at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com/) and I'm keen to finish it because I've been working on my SOLID and TDD processes to reconcile interative, agile approaches, with the incremental nature of complexity. For each of the projects we've worked on at Makers, I've always found the planning and modelling stages to be secrectly really fascinating, and definately a key predictor of the final build success.|

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Apr 2021 to Jul 2021)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
