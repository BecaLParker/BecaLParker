## Rebecca Parker

I completed the [Makers developer bootcamp](https://makers.tech/about-us/) in July 2021. I now work as a Software Engineer at [Redgate Software](https://www.red-gate.com/), where I test and write code as part of a team. We build and improve database tools for our awesome customers.
